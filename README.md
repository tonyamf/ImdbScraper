1. Web Scraping with Scrapy
Purpose: Extract animation TV series/mini-series data from IMDb released in 2022.

Key Components:
Spider Name: imdbshowsSpider

Target URL: Filters 2022 releases with animation genre, TV series/mini-series type, and minimum 1 vote.

Data Extracted:

Ranking position (place)

Title (title)

IMDb rating (rate)

Number of votes (vote)

Pagination Handling: Follows "Next" page links recursively.

Code Flow:
Starts at the initial URL.

Parses the HTML response using XPath selectors.

Yields extracted data as dictionaries.

Checks for a "Next Page" link and repeats the process.

2. Data Processing & Analysis
Purpose: Calculate a custom weighted score (cal) to rank shows.

Key Steps:
Data Loading:

alldata.csv: Raw scraped data.

series22.csv: Additional reference data (assumed to have matching titles).

Data Cleaning:

Remove commas from vote columns.

Convert vote and place to numeric types.

Statistical Metrics:

Compute means (vm, rm, pm) and max values (pM, vM) for votes, ratings, and rankings.

Custom Score Calculation:

A complex formula combining:

Weighted average of rating and vote count.

Normalization by max/mean values.

Multiple additive terms balancing popularity and ranking position.

Example term:

python
(row['vote'] / (row['vote'] + vm)) * ((pM - row['place']) / pM * 10)

3. Data Merging & Output
Purpose: Generate a ranked list of shows based on the custom score.

Workflow:
Merge Datasets:

Inner join alldata and series on title.

Sorting:

Order by cal (descending) to prioritize top-rated shows.

Output:

Save results to out.csv.

Key Issues & Improvements
Data Cleaning:

Problem: Assumes no missing/invalid values in vote or place.

Fix: Use error handling (e.g., pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')).

Formula Complexity:

Problem: The cal formula is overly complex and hard to debug.

Fix: Break into smaller, documented components.

Efficiency:

Problem: Loops over DataFrame rows are slow.

Fix: Vectorize operations (e.g., alldata['cal'] = ... without loops).

Matching Titles:

Problem: Inner join on title may exclude entries due to typos or formatting differences.

Fix: Use fuzzy string matching (e.g., fuzzywuzzy library).

Scrapy Spider:

Problem: XPath selectors are fragile to HTML changes.

Fix: Use CSS selectors or test robustness.

Example Output (out.csv)
place	title	rate	vote	cal
1	"Arcane"	9.0	250,000	95.2
2	"Attack on Titan"	8.9	180,000	92.1
...	...	...	...	...

Use Case
This code could be used by animation studios or streaming platforms to:

Identify trending shows.

Prioritize content acquisition based on popularity/quality metrics.
